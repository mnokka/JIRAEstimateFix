# JIRAEstimateFix

JIRA Scrum board does not let use subtask estimates ( problem: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSW-9167#comment-1038295 )
The Atlassian issue is still open. Alexandre Ouicher released nice script runner fix for it.

This repo presents lightly modified variant of the original fix

NOTES:
* Script Runner (server) version 4.3.16 was needed (earlier version caused issue loading to fail)
* See code for usage info
